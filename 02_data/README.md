This guide outlines the functional data organization critical to our project, highlighting the specific purpose of each dedicated data directory.

## 01_source_data
- **Raw Data Repository**: Contains unaltered, original datasets acquired directly for analysis.
   - `01_source_data/`: Raw data files.Initial datasets pre-alterations or preprocessing.

## 02_intermediate_data
- **Transformation Hub**: Stores data undergoing initial cleaning and transformation stages.
   - `02_intermediate_data/`: Data post initial cleaning and transformation. Holds interim outputs and transitional datasets.

## 03_final_data
- **Refined Data Vault**: Repository for immaculate, refined datasets prepared for analysis.
   - `03_final_data/`: Data after extensive cleansing and refinement. Houses ultimate outputs and refined datasets.

This structured data architecture ensures a clear progression from raw inputs through transformation to the refined, analysis-ready outputs, pivotal for our project's success.
