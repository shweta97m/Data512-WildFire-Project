    "# Air Quality Index\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook we have obtained the wildfire related data for the city of Bismarck, North Dakota. After analysing the data and understanding the data, there was a mechanism devised to estimate an index to measure the smoke for the city assigned. By referring to several resources, an arbitarary formula was devised to calculate the index. However, one very important aspect to check the validity of the estimate is to compare it to the ground reality. Hence, we are pulling Air quality index data from the API to check against our calculated estimates"

    "## Brief Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The US EPA was only created in 1973, and did not really begin installing air quality monitoring stations until the early 1980s. Further, of 3000+ counties in the US, the EPA has vetted monitoring stations in only 2000 of them. This means that US EPA AQI measures for any one city will need to be some kind of estimate based on monitoring stations that are nearby. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates how to request data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Service (AQS) API. This is a historical API and does not provide real-time air quality data. The [documentation](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) for the API provides definitions of the different call parameter and examples of the various calls that can be made to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works systematically through example calls, requesting an API key, using 'list' to get various IDs and parameter values, and using 'daily summary' to get summary data that meets specific condistions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API helps resolve this by providing calls to search for monitoring stations and data using either station ids, or a county designation or a geographic bounding box. This example code provides examples of the county based and bounding box based API calls. Some [additional information on the Air Quality System can be found in the EPA FAQ](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/frequent-questions-about-airdata) on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal of this example is to get to some values that we might use for the Air Quality Index or AQI. You might see this reported on the news, most often around smog, but more frequently with regard to smoke. The AQI index is meant to tell us something about how healthy or clean the air is on any day. The AQI is actually a somewhat complext measure. When I started this example I looked up [how to calculate the AQI](https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/aqi-technical-assistance-document-sept2018.pdf) so that I would know roughly what goes into that value.\n",
