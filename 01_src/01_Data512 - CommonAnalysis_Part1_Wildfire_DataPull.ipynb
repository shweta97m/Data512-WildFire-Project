The notebook is structure as a set of examples that illustrate something about the structure of the data or illustrate a way to compute specific values. This notebook is not a tutorial on performing geodetic computations, but illustrates a number of key concepts. This notebook should provide enough information to complete the Wildfire assignment. The complete [Wildfire dataset](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81) can be retrieved from a US government repository.

The wildfire user module should be downloaded from the course website, unzipped, and moved into the folder pointed to by your PYTHONPATH system variable.\n",

One task is to define your smoke estimate and then apply it to every fire for your city. Should your smoke estimate be cumulative during each year or somehow amortized over the fire season?
