# Data 512 - Wildfire Impact Analysis Project
## Bismarck, North Dakota

## Project Goal
The course project delves deep into examining the ramifications of wildfires on a specific U.S. city. Summers in the western United States have witnessed an escalating occurrence of wildfires, disseminating smoke across multiple states. Proposed causes encompass factors like climate change, U.S. forestry policies, and heightened awareness. Our primary aim is to furnish invaluable insights to policymakers, city administrators, city councils, and civic institutions. These insights will empower informed decision-making to formulate effective strategies in mitigating future wildfire impacts. 

As part of this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis focusing on the socio-economic ramifications of the wildfire on **Bismarck, North Dakota** from 1963 to the present day.

## Project Parts

### Part 1 - Common Analysis
Conducted a thorough analysis of wildfire impact on the selected city. Developed an initial prediction model for smoke and assessed its implications on various aspects including health, economics, services, education, and community differences.

### Part 2 - Extension Plan
Extended the initial analysis by modifying the smoke prediction model to estimate specific social or economic impacts on the city. Focused areas include health care, economics, services, education, and community differences. The objective was to provide actionable insights to city officials and residents.

### Part 3 - Presentation
Created a concise PechaKucha presentation summarizing the project findings. Presented the analysis results and implications to city officials, council members, and residents in an engaging format.

### Part 4 - Project Repository
Developed a fully documented repository and a comprehensive written project report. Compiled all analyses, models, and findings to inform policy makers, city managers, and civic institutions about potential future impacts and mitigation strategies.

## Known Issues or Special Considerations with the Data

Special care and attention need to be given to this section if implementing this project.

- The dataset covers wildfires from 1963 to 2023, but limitations exist in pinpointing exact fire start and end dates
- Availability and reliability of Air Quality Index (AQI) data might vary across different regions
- Incorporating the selected attributes of fires into smoke impact estimation poses challenges due to data constraints
- The EPA's monitoring station coverage might not be exhaustive, affecting AQI estimations for specific cities
- AQI was only limited to particulate matter since there was limited information about the gaseous impact
- The missing values for AQI were filled with average values
- AQI API needs credentials and setup before we can request the data
- Runtime is significantly high for the USGS GeoJSON
- Parts 2 and 3 are implemented with a sole focus in mind and do not consider any additional Impacting factors
- Model Predictions are subject to uncertainty and a certain error margin should be expected
- Yield forecast methodology needs more refinement and statistical proof of the result
- Correlation is used to maintain a relationship between variables, however, correlation is not equal to causation. Causation testing is beyond the scope of the project
- The extended analysis is done for the county of Burleigh, of which Bismarck, North Dakota is a part 



This README provides an overview of the project's goal, emphasizing the analysis of wildfire impacts and the aim to provide valuable insights for city stakeholders and residents
