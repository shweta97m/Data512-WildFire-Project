### `Data512 - WildfireProject_Part1_NoFires_over_Dist_Histogram`

- **Description**: Graph Description: 
The graph represents the histogram of the fires and their distribution over the distance from Bismarck, 
North Dakota. The histogram illustrates the spatial distribution of fires concerning their occurrence 
frequency at 50-mile intervals from the assigned city.

### `Data512 - WildfireProject_Part1_Burned_Area_TimeSeries`

- **Description**:The graph represents the time series representation of the total area that burned down during the 
wildfire. The data was generated in the data analysis part of the common analysis. This is being plotted 
against the temporal span. The graph considers all the fires that were maximum at a distance of 1250 miles 
from Bismarck.


### `Data512 - WildfireProject_Part1_SmokeEstimate_vs_AQI_TimeSeries`   

- **Description**: The graph above represents the time series representation of the estimated smoke impact that was generated 
in the data analysis part of the common analysis. This is being plotted against the Air Quality Index 
estimates that we obtained from the API over the years. 

This structured data architecture ensures a clear progression of the results crucial for our project's success.
